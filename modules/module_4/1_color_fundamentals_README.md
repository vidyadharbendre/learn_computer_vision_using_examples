# Fundamentals of Color Perception and Characteristics

## 1. Color Perception Overview
The perception and interpretation of color by the human brain is a complex physiopsychological phenomenon not fully understood. However, the physical nature of color can be described using experimental and theoretical findings.

### Newton's Discovery (1666)
- Sunlight passing through a glass prism creates a continuous spectrum of colors: Violet, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red.
- Colors blend smoothly without abrupt transitions between them.

### Color Perception
- The color perceived in an object depends on the light it reflects.
- Visible light spans a narrow range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum (400-700 nm).
- Objects reflecting all visible wavelengths appear white; those reflecting limited ranges show specific colors (e.g., green objects reflect 500-570 nm).

### Types of Light
- **Achromatic Light**: Lacks color, only has intensity. Seen in old black-and-white films.
- **Chromatic Light**: Contains color and spans from 400-700 nm.

### Key Quantities of Chromatic Light
- **Radiance**: Total energy emitted by a light source (measured in watts).
- **Luminance**: The amount of energy perceived by an observer (measured in lumens).
- **Brightness**: A subjective perception of light intensity, difficult to measure.

These attributes help in understanding and characterizing color in the context of the electromagnetic spectrum.

## 2. Human Color Perception and Light

### Cones in the Eye
- The human eye has 6 to 7 million cones responsible for color vision.
- These cones are categorized into three types: red, green, and blue-sensitive.
  - **65%** of cones are sensitive to red light.
  - **33%** are sensitive to green light.
  - **2%** are sensitive to blue light, though blue cones are the most sensitive.
- These cones allow the human eye to perceive colors as combinations of red (R), green (G), and blue (B).

### CIE Primary Colors
- In 1931, the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) defined specific wavelength values for primary colors:
  - **Blue**: 435.8 nm
  - **Green**: 546.1 nm
  - **Red**: 700 nm
- These standards don't perfectly align with experimental data but were set for consistency in color definition.

### Primary and Secondary Colors
- **Primary Colors of Light (Additive)**: Red, Green, Blue (R, G, B).
  - Mixing these primary colors produces secondary colors:
    - **Magenta** (Red + Blue)
    - **Cyan** (Green + Blue)
    - **Yellow** (Red + Green)
  - Combining all three primary colors results in **white light**.
- **Primary Colors of Pigments (Subtractive)**: Magenta, Cyan, Yellow (M, C, Y).
  - Combining these pigment primaries or their opposites produces **black**.

### CRT and Digital Displays
- **CRT Displays**: Early color TV screens used phosphor dots emitting red, green, and blue light, which were modulated by electron guns to display images.
- **LCD and Plasma Displays**: Modern displays use three subpixels (R, G, B) to form one color pixel. LCDs use polarized light, while plasma screens use phosphor-coated gas cells.

### Color Characteristics
- Colors are distinguished by:
  - **Brightness**: Intensity of light.
  - **Hue**: Dominant wavelength (e.g., red, yellow).
  - **Saturation**: Purity of the color (the less white light, the higher the saturation).
- **Tristimulus Values**: The amounts of red, green, and blue required to form a particular color are known as tristimulus values (X, Y, Z). These values are normalized as:
  - `x = X / (X + Y + Z)`
  - `y = Y / (X + Y + Z)`
  - `z = Z / (X + Y + Z)`
  - The sum of `x + y + z = 1`.

### CIE Chromaticity Diagram
- The **CIE Chromaticity Diagram** shows the relationship between color components (x for red, y for green, and z for blue).
- Colors on the boundary represent fully saturated colors, while colors inside the diagram are mixtures of spectrum colors.
- The **point of equal energy** represents the standard for **white light**, and any point inside the diagram represents a mix of primary colors.

### Color Mixing
- Color mixing can be visualized on the chromaticity diagram:
  - A line connecting two colors defines all colors between them.
  - Mixing three colors results in a triangle, with all colors within the triangle being achievable by additive combinations of the three primary colors.
  - Not all colors can be generated with three fixed primary colors, which is graphically supported by the shape of the triangle.

### Key Takeaways
- The perception of color relies on three types of cones (R, G, B) in the eye.
- The CIE established standardized primary color wavelengths, which serve as a reference but do not fully match experimental data.
- Color can be represented in terms of brightness, hue, saturation, and chromaticity, and is often mixed using the RGB and CMY models for light and pigments, respectively.
