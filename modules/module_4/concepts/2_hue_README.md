# Hue

## Overview
Hue refers to the attribute of color that defines its position on the color spectrum. It is essentially the **color** itself, such as red, green, blue, or yellow. Hue is the most intuitive aspect of color and helps in identifying and naming different colors.

## Key Concepts
- **Primary Colors**: Red, green, and blue (in the RGB model) are examples of primary hues.
- **Secondary Colors**: Mixing primary hues results in secondary colors, such as cyan, magenta, and yellow.
  
## How Hue Affects Color Perception
- Hue is represented as an angular value in a color wheel, typically ranging from 0° to 360°.
- Each angle corresponds to a specific color:
  - **0°**: Red
  - **120°**: Green
  - **240°**: Blue
  - **360°**: Red (back to the start)

## Relationship to Other Color Attributes
- **Saturation** and **Brightness** work with hue to create the full range of color perceptions.
- A color's hue determines its basic identity, while saturation and brightness modify how the color appears.

## Conclusion
Hue is fundamental in defining what we perceive as a particular color. It serves as the foundation for all color systems and color mixing processes.
