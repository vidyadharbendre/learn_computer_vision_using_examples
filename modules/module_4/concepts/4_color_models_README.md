# Fundamentals of Color Models in Image Processing

## Overview
Color models are mathematical representations that describe and define colors. They play a crucial role in image processing, computer graphics, and visual media by enabling the manipulation, analysis, and reproduction of colors in digital and print mediums.

## RGB Color Model

### Introduction
The **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)** model is an **additive color model** used to create a broad spectrum of colors by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light.

### Key Characteristics
- **Color Representation**:  
  Colors are expressed as a triplet `(R, G, B)`, where each component ranges from 0 to 255.
- **Applications**:  
  - Digital displays (e.g., monitors, projectors).  
  - Image editing software.  
  - Web design.  

### Working Principle
1. The intensity of red, green, and blue is combined.
2. Maximum intensity of all three (`255, 255, 255`) results in white.
3. Zero intensity (`0, 0, 0`) results in black.

## CMY Color Model

### Introduction
The **CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)** model is a **subtractive color model** primarily used in color printing.

### Key Characteristics
- **Color Representation**:  
  Colors are expressed as a triplet `(C, M, Y)` where each value represents the percentage of cyan, magenta, and yellow.
- **Applications**:  
  - Printing technologies.  
  - Color reproduction in physical media.  

### Working Principle
1. White light is reflected off the surface and modified by the cyan, magenta, and yellow filters.
2. The absence of all three components results in white, while combining them fully (`100%, 100%, 100%`) results in black.

## HSI Color Model

### Introduction
The **HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity)** model represents colors in terms of human perception, making it more intuitive than RGB or CMY.

### Key Characteristics
- **Components**:  
  - **Hue**: Represents the color type (e.g., red, green, blue).  
  - **Saturation**: Represents the vibrancy or purity of the color.  
  - **Intensity**: Represents the brightness of the color.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Image analysis.  
  - Computer vision.  

### Working Principle
1. **Hue** is determined by the wavelength of light.  
2. **Saturation** defines the amount of white light mixed with the color.  
3. **Intensity** represents the total light energy.
