# Color Complements: Applications and Example

This project demonstrates the concept of **Color Complements** in image processing using Python and OpenCV. The complement of a color is its opposite on the color wheel, and applying this concept to an image can help:

1. Enhance details in dark regions.
2. Create visually striking effects similar to photographic negatives.
3. Highlight contrasts in color-dominant areas.

## 5W1H Breakdown of Color Complements

### **What** are Color Complements?
Color complements involve replacing each color in an image with its opposite on the color wheel. For example:
- **Red** becomes **Cyan**
- **Green** becomes **Magenta**
- **Blue** becomes **Yellow**

In grayscale images, complements resemble "negatives" where bright pixels become dark and vice versa.

### **Why** use Color Complements?
Color complements are useful for:
- **Enhancing Details**: Improve contrast and make faint features more visible.
- **Artistic Effects**: Generate visually interesting transformations for creativity.
- **Image Analysis**: Highlight differences or specific features in color images.

---

### **Who** benefits from Color Complements?
- **Photographers**: For artistic and visual enhancements.
- **Scientists**: To analyze images with enhanced contrasts.
- **Graphic Designers**: For creative effects in their designs.
- **Developers**: In computer vision or image preprocessing tasks.

---

### **Where** can this be applied?
- **Scientific Imaging**: To highlight details in microscopic or astronomical images.
- **Art and Design**: For aesthetic enhancements in digital media.
- **Computer Vision**: For object segmentation and feature extraction.

---

### **When** should you use Color Complements?
- **Low Visibility Areas**: To bring out details in dark or low-contrast regions.
- **For Artistic Transformation**: When creating image effects or designs.
- **For Feature Highlighting**: When contrasting elements need emphasis.
