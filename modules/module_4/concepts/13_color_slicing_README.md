# **Color Slicing in Image Processing**

## **Theory: Color Slicing**

**Color Slicing** is a technique used to highlight or isolate a specific range of colors in an image. This method is helpful for extracting objects of a certain color from their surroundings, allowing further processing like object segmentation or enhancement.

### **The Concept of Color Slicing:**
1. **Basic Idea**: 
   - The goal is either:
     1. Display the colors of interest so they stand out from the background.
     2. Use the colors of interest as a mask for further processing (e.g., object extraction).
     
2. **Color Pixel Transformation**:
   - In grayscale images, intensity slicing is a straightforward method, but color pixels are multi-dimensional, making the transformations more complex.
   - A typical approach to color slicing involves mapping colors outside a defined range to a neutral color (e.g., middle gray in RGB space: (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)).
   
3. **Defining the Range**:
   - Colors of interest can be enclosed by a **cube** or **sphere** in color space, centered around a prototypical color (e.g., an average or typical color). The range of interest defines the boundaries for color selection.
   
4. **Transformations**:
   - **Cube-based transformation**: Colors outside a defined width (W) are transformed to neutral.
   - **Sphere-based transformation**: Colors outside a radius (R) from the prototypical color are replaced by neutral.
   
5. **Example**:
   - To isolate strawberries from their background, color slicing was applied to highlight red regions based on a color prototype in RGB space.

### **Applications**:
- Color slicing is useful for tasks such as:
  1. Object detection and segmentation.
  2. Background removal.
  3. Image enhancement.
  4. Creating visually striking effects.
  
## **Program: Color Slicing Using OpenCV**

This Python program demonstrates the **color slicing** technique using the **OpenCV** library. It highlights a specific color range in an image and replaces colors outside the selected range with a neutral color.

### **Steps**:
1. **Image Loading**: The image is loaded using OpenCV.
2. **Color Range Selection**: We define a range for the color of interest (e.g., red for strawberries).
3. **Mask Creation**: A mask is created by selecting pixels within the color range.
4. **Color Replacement**: Pixels outside the range are replaced by a neutral color (gray in this case).
5. **Displaying the Results**: The original and color-sliced images are displayed side-by-side.

### **Code Implementation:**
