# Saturation

## Overview
Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of a color. It indicates how vivid or muted a color appears. A highly saturated color looks more vibrant and pure, while a color with low saturation appears dull or grayish.

## Key Concepts
- **High Saturation**: Colors that are vivid and pure, without any dilution from gray. For example, a bright red or turquoise is highly saturated.
- **Low Saturation**: Colors that appear washed out, pastel-like, or close to gray. For example, light pink or faded blue would have low saturation.

## How Saturation Affects Color Perception
- **100% Saturation**: The color is pure and rich in its hue.
- **0% Saturation**: The color is gray, with no chromatic content, appearing as a shade of neutral gray.

## Relationship to Other Color Attributes
- Saturation is often used alongside **hue** and **brightness** in color models like **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)** or **HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)**.
- Saturation controls the vividness, while hue dictates the type of color, and brightness defines how light or dark the color is.

## Conclusion
Saturation is a key factor in determining the intensity of a color. By adjusting saturation, you can control how vibrant or muted a color appears in various design applications.
