| **Aspect**                 | **Original Code (Intensity Slicing)**                         | **New Code (Colormap Application)**                                |

| **Goal**                    | Apply custom color coding based on intensity ranges.           | Apply predefined colormaps to the entire grayscale image.           |
| **Approach**                | Divides intensity range into discrete slices and applies a color for each slice. | Maps intensity values continuously to colors using predefined colormaps. |
| **Type of Mapping**         | Discrete intensity ranges (slicing) mapped to distinct colors. | Continuous color mapping based on colormap.                          |
| **Color Representation**    | Custom colors like Red, Green, Yellow, Cyan for different intensity ranges. | Predefined OpenCV colormaps (e.g., `JET`, `VIRIDIS`, `COOL`).      |
| **Colormap Customization**  | Custom color mapping for specific intensity intervals.        | Uses built-in colormaps that are generally predefined and less customizable. |
| **Visual Effect**           | Segmented color coding based on defined intensity ranges.     | Smooth gradient of colors applied to the entire image.             |
| **Image Output**            | One color-coded image based on specific intensity slices.     | Multiple images showing the original and several color-mapped versions. |
| **Image Segmentation**      | Explicit segmentation into distinct intensity ranges.         | No segmentation; a smooth transition between intensity values and colors. |
| **Ease of Use**             | Requires manual definition of intensity ranges and color assignments. | Simple to implement using OpenCV's `applyColorMap()` function.      |
| **Use Case**                | Good for emphasizing specific intensity ranges (e.g., heatmaps with distinct thresholds). | Ideal for creating aesthetically pleasing color mappings (e.g., for data visualization). |
| **Computation Complexity**  | Slightly more computational overhead due to mask creation for each intensity range. | Generally faster as it uses optimized colormap functions in OpenCV. |
