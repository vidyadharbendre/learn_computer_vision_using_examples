# Brightness

## Overview
Brightness refers to the perceived intensity of light emitted or reflected by a color. It represents how light or dark a color appears to the human eye, depending on the amount of light the color reflects. Brightness is a key component in color perception, affecting how vibrant or muted a color seems.

## Key Concepts
- **High Brightness**: Colors with high brightness appear lighter and closer to white. For example, a light yellow or sky blue is considered bright.
- **Low Brightness**: Colors with low brightness appear darker, resembling shades of black or gray. An example would be dark green or maroon.

## Relationship to Other Color Attributes
- Brightness is one of the three dimensions in the **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)** or **HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)** color models.
- It is influenced by the **lightness** of the color, where increasing brightness adds white, and decreasing brightness adds black.
  
## How Brightness Affects Perception
- Colors with high brightness are often perceived as more energetic or lighter.
- Colors with low brightness can evoke a sense of heaviness or darkness.

## Conclusion
Brightness plays a critical role in how we visually perceive the overall lightness or darkness of a color. By adjusting brightness, one can make a color appear lighter or darker, which is especially important in design and art.
