# ## Sampling Pitch in Image Sensors

## Introduction

**Sampling pitch** refers to the physical spacing between adjacent sensor cells on the imaging chip. It plays a crucial role in determining image resolution, detail, and the sensor's ability to capture light, particularly in low-light conditions. A smaller sampling pitch offers higher resolution but can be more prone to noise, especially in low-light settings.

> *"The sampling pitch is the physical spacing between adjacent sensor cells on the imaging chip (Figure 2.24). A sensor with a smaller sampling pitch has a higher sampling density and hence provides a higher resolution (in terms of pixels) for a given active chip area. However, a smaller pitch also means that each sensor has a smaller area and cannot accumulate as many photons; this makes it not as light sensitive and more prone to noise."*

## How Sampling Pitch Works

- **Smaller Pitch**: Higher resolution and more detail but less light sensitivity.
- **Larger Pitch**: More light sensitivity and better low-light performance, but lower resolution.

Sampling pitch determines how many photons can be captured by each pixel, which directly impacts image quality in low-light conditions.

### Examples:

- **Smaller Pitch (e.g., 1.1μm)**: Suitable for bright environments, offering sharper images with finer details.
- **Larger Pitch (e.g., 4.3μm)**: Ideal for low-light conditions where more light is needed per pixel.

## Conclusion

Sampling pitch plays a significant role in balancing image resolution with light sensitivity. Photographers should choose based on the lighting environment and required detail level.
