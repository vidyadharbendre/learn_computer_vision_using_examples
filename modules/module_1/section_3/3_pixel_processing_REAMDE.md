## Pixel Processing

Pixel processing is one of the simplest forms of image processing. It involves examining each individual pixel in an image to assess its brightness and color values. This analysis allows us to apply transformations based on predetermined formulas.

### Key Points:
- **Simplicity**: The process is straightforward, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Individual Pixel Assessment**: Each pixel is evaluated for its color and brightness.
- **Transformations**: Using defined mathematical formulas, we can modify the pixel values to achieve desired effects, such as brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, or color manipulation.

Overall, pixel processing serves as a foundational technique that underlies more complex image processing tasks.
