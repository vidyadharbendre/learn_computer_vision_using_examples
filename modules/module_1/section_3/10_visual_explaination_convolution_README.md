## Visual Explanation of Convolution for Continuous-Time Signals

The convolution of two continuous-time signals can be described by the following integral:

'**g(x) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(τ) h(x - τ) dτ**'

This process can be broken down into five key steps:

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of Convolution:

1. **Flip the Impulse Response ('h(-τ)')**:
    - The first step in convolution is to flip the impulse response function 'h(τ)' horizontally to create 'h(-τ)'. This reflects the function around the vertical axis.
    - This flipping operation ensures that the function is evaluated for all possible shifts relative to the input signal 'f(τ)'.

2. **Shift the Flipped Function ('h(x - τ)')**:
    - Once 'h(τ)' has been flipped, it is shifted along the x-axis by 'x' to become 'h(x - τ)'. 
    - This shifting represents the time-shifted impulse response and allows us to evaluate how the system responds to different time shifts of the input signal.

3. **Overlay the Shifted Function onto the Input Signal ('f(τ)')**:
    - The next step is to overlay or align the shifted version of 'h(x - τ)' with the input signal 'f(τ)'. 
    - This step is crucial as it prepares for the multiplication of the two functions.

4. **Take the Product of the Two Functions ('f(τ) * h(x - τ)')**:
    - Multiply the input signal 'f(τ)' with the shifted and flipped impulse response 'h(x - τ)' at each point along the time axis.
    - This product represents the interaction between the input and the system’s impulse response for a specific shift.

5. **Integrate to Get a Single Value ('g(x)')**:
    - Finally, integrate the product 'f(τ) * h(x - τ)' over the entire range from '-∞' to '∞'. This integral gives a single value that represents the output signal 'g(x)' at that point 'x'.
    - This single value (often represented visually in green) is the result of the convolution at the specific point 'x'.

### Sliding Over the Entire Range:

- To obtain the complete output signal 'g(x)', repeat this process for all values of 'x'. This means sliding 'h(x - τ)' across the entire range of the input signal 'f(τ)', calculating the product at each point, and integrating.
- The final convolution result 'g(x)' is the continuous combination of all these individual values over the full range.

### Conclusion:

The convolution operation essentially slides the impulse response 'h(x)' across the input signal 'f(x)', multiplies the two functions at each shift, and sums the product (via integration). This process provides the output 'g(x)', which characterizes how the system responds to the input based on its impulse response.
