## Why Do We Need Image Processing?

Image processing is essential for several reasons:

1. **Enhancement**: It improves the visual quality of images, making them clearer and more appealing for human perception.

2. **Feature Extraction**: It enables the identification and extraction of important features from images, which is crucial in fields like computer vision and machine learning.

3. **Data Analysis**: Image processing allows for the analysis of visual data, aiding in tasks such as medical diagnosis, surveillance, and industrial inspection.

4. **Automation**: It facilitates automation in various applications, from facial recognition to autonomous vehicles, improving efficiency and accuracy.

5. **Image Compression**: It helps in reducing the file size of images for easier storage and transmission while preserving essential details.

6. **Image Restoration**: It assists in recovering images that may have been degraded by noise, blurring, or other distortions.

Overall, image processing is a fundamental component in transforming raw visual data into meaningful information and actionable insights.
