# Convolution of Two Identical Rectangular Functions in LSIS

In the context of a **Linear Shift Invariant System (LSIS)**, convolution is an essential operation that defines how an input signal interacts with the system's impulse response to produce an output signal.

### Problem Setup

Let us say that you want to convolve two identical rectangular functions:
- The **blue rectangle** represents the input signal 'f(x)' with a width ranging from -1 to 1, and a height of 1.
- The **red rectangle** represents the impulse response 'h(x)' with the same width and height.

### Step-by-Step Visual Explanation of Convolution

#### 1. **Input Signal 'f(x)'**:
   - This is a **blue rectangle** (step function) extending from -1 to 1, with a height of 1.
   - Mathematically, we can express this as:
     - 'f(x) = 1, \text{for} -1 \leq x \leq 1'
     - 'f(x) = 0, \text{otherwise}'

#### 2. **Impulse Response 'h(x)'**:
   - This is a **red rectangle** with the same properties as 'f(x)', also ranging from -1 to 1 and with a height of 1.
   - Mathematically:
     - 'h(x) = 1, \text{for} -1 \leq x \leq 1'
     - 'h(x) = 0, \text{otherwise}'

### Convolution Steps

#### 1. **Flip the Impulse Response 'h(x)'**:
   - Convolution requires flipping the impulse response, which means reflecting 'h(x)' across the vertical axis. However, since 'h(x)' is symmetric, flipping does not change its shape.
   - After flipping, 'h(x)' remains identical.

#### 2. **Shift 'h(x)' Over 'f(x)'**:
   - Begin shifting the flipped 'h(x)' from left to right across 'f(x)'.
   - As you shift 'h(x)' over 'f(x)', for each position 'x', the convolution operation computes a value based on how much the two functions overlap.

#### 3. **Overlay the Functions**:
   - As 'h(x)' shifts, overlay the two functions to check the extent of their overlap. The goal is to compute the convolution result at each point 'x'.

#### 4. **Multiply the Functions**:
   - For each value of 'x', multiply the corresponding values of 'f(τ)' and 'h(x - τ)'. This product is computed point-by-point where the two rectangles overlap.

#### 5. **Sum (Integrate) the Product**:
   - After multiplying the two functions, sum (or integrate) the resulting values over the range where they overlap.
   - For continuous functions, the convolution is given by:
     - 'g(x) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} f(τ) h(x - τ) dτ'
   - In our case, since both functions are non-zero only from -1 to 1, the integral simplifies over this range.

#### 6. **Result of Convolution**:
   - The resulting signal 'g(x)' is the convolution of 'f(x)' with 'h(x)'. In this case, since both are identical rectangles, the result will resemble a **trapezoidal shape**:
     - From -2 to -1: The overlap gradually increases.
     - From -1 to 1: Maximum overlap occurs, resulting in the peak of the trapezoid.
     - From 1 to 2: The overlap gradually decreases again.

   - Mathematically, this process follows the convolution rule:
     - 'g(x) = f(x) * h(x)'
