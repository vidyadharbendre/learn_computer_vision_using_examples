# Understanding Rotationally Symmetric vs Anisotropic BRDF

This document provides a clear understanding of the difference between rotationally symmetric and anisotropic Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) using visual examples with iron balls. We'll observe how light interacts differently in each case.

## 1. Rotationally Symmetric BRDF (Isotropic Material)

### Example
Imagine two polished iron balls with a smooth, uniformly finished surface placed on a table. Now, you rotate the surface or spin the balls.

### Behavior
In this case, when you rotate the surface, the way light reflects off the iron balls doesn't change. This is because the surface material (iron) has an isotropic BRDF, meaning the reflection properties are the same in all directions. The light bounces off uniformly, no matter which direction the light comes from or how the surface is oriented.

### Key Characteristics
- **Consistent Reflections**: Reflections remain the same as the surface or object rotates.
- **No Directional Variation**: The reflection doesn't change regardless of orientation.
- **Example Materials**: Polished metals like iron, gold, silver, and smooth plastics.

## 2. Anisotropic BRDF (Anisotropic Material)

### Example
Now, take two iron balls, but this time they have distinct surface textures. For instance, one ball has a brushed metal finish, where tiny grooves are aligned in a specific direction. Place these balls on the same surface and rotate the surface.

### Behavior
As you rotate the surface, the light reflecting off the balls will change based on the direction of the grooves. The reflection will appear different when the grooves are aligned parallel versus perpendicular to the light source. This happens because the surface is anisotropic, meaning the reflection properties vary depending on the direction of the surface texture. As the surface rotates, you will notice shifts in highlights and shadows, emphasizing the directional nature of the reflections.

### Key Characteristics
- **Directional Reflections**: Reflections change with the rotation of the object or surface.
- **Surface-Dependent Reflection**: The reflection is influenced by the surface structure, such as grooves, fibers, or patterns.
- **Example Materials**: Brushed metals, hair, fabrics, and wood grain.

## 3. Visual Understanding

- **Rotationally Symmetric (Isotropic)**: The reflection remains the same from every angle, similar to a smooth iron ball. When you spin the surface, the light interaction doesn't change.
  
- **Anisotropic**: The reflection changes when the surface is spun, like in a brushed metal ball. The direction of the grooves affects how the light reflects, making the appearance different from various angles.

This contrast highlights how anisotropic materials produce unique light effects based on their surface texture, while isotropic materials reflect light uniformly in all directions.
