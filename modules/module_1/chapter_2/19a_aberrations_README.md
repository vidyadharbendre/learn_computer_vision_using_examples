# Understanding Optical Aberrations in Lenses

## Aberrations in Lenses
Even with perfectly manufactured lenses, **aberrations** or undesirable effects still occur. These distortions impact the quality of the final image. To correct these issues and achieve the desired clarity and precision, optical systems often employ multiple lenses.

## Single vs. Compound Lenses
While we may use a **single lens** for conceptual understanding, real-world imaging systems frequently utilize **compound lenses**, consisting of multiple lensesâ€”sometimes 7 to 8 or more. This configuration helps correct various optical aberrations and significantly improves image quality.

## Lens Design and Aberration Correction
In a compound lens system, a series of lenses of different shapes and sizes are used to compensate for the undesirable effects of individual elements. The combination of these lenses ultimately results in a **high-quality image** by minimizing the impact of optical aberrations.

Optical aberrations are an essential consideration in lens design, and understanding how different lens systems work is critical to producing accurate and sharp images.
