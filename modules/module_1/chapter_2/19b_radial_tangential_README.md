# Lens Aberrations and Distortions

## Bulging or Barrel (Radial) Distortion

**Barrel distortion** is a type of radial distortion that causes straight lines to appear as if they are bulging outward from the center of the image. This effect is common when using wide-angle or cheaper lenses, where the image appears to "stretch" more towards the edges, causing a barrel-like appearance. 

- **Effect**: Image "stretches" more toward the edges.
- **Appearance**: The image takes on a "barrel-like" shape.
- **Cause**: Common in wide-angle or lower-quality lenses.
- **Severity**: More pronounced the further the object is from the center.

## Tangential Distortion

**Tangential distortion** occurs when there is a twisting or skewing effect in the image that increases as you move further away from the center of the lens. 

- **Effect**: Bends the image, making objects appear slanted or twisted.
- **Appearance**: Lines appear increasingly slanted toward the edges of the image.
- **Cause**: The skewing occurs when the optical center does not align correctly with the sensor.
- **Severity**: Increases the further you move from the center of the lens.

## Impact of Lens Quality on Aberrations

The **quality of the lens** plays a significant role in the occurrence of aberrations like radial and tangential distortions.

- **Cheaper lenses**: Often exhibit more pronounced radial and tangential distortions.
- **Higher-quality lenses**: Minimize these aberrations, resulting in clearer and more accurate images.

**Takeaway**: Investing in higher-quality lenses can help reduce unwanted distortions and improve image quality.
