# Resolution

Resolution is a key factor in determining the detail and clarity of images captured by digital cameras.

## What is Resolution?

- **Definition**: The amount of detail an image holds, typically measured in pixels (width x height).
- **Common Resolutions**: 1920x1080 (Full HD), 3840x2160 (4K), 8000x6000 (36MP).

## Importance of Resolution

1. **Image Quality**: Higher resolution provides more detail and allows for larger prints.
2. **Cropping Flexibility**: Higher resolution images can be cropped without losing significant quality.
