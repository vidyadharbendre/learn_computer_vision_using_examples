# Zenith Angle in BRDF

The zenith angle is a key component in the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), describing the angular relationship between light and a surface.

## 1. Definition of Zenith Angle

The **zenith angle (θ)** is the angle between the surface normal and the direction of incoming or outgoing light. It describes the **vertical direction** of the light relative to the surface.

## 2. Role in BRDF

In the BRDF, the zenith angle describes the angular relationship of light incident on a surface, as well as the reflected light. The BRDF function is expressed as:

'f_r(θ_i, φ_i, θ_r, φ_r)'

where:
- 'θ_i' is the zenith angle of the incoming light.
- 'θ_r' is the zenith angle of the outgoing light.
- 'φ_i' and 'φ_r' represent the azimuth angles for the incoming and outgoing directions.

## 3. Importance of Zenith Angle

The zenith angle is critical in determining the intensity and direction of reflected light. It provides information about how light behaves as it strikes the surface at varying angles. For surfaces with diffuse or specular properties, the zenith angle influences the amount of light reflected or absorbed.

## 4. Applications

The zenith angle is important in many fields such as computer graphics, where light reflection must be modeled accurately. It is also relevant in remote sensing and optical analysis to understand how light interacts with different surfaces in various environments.
