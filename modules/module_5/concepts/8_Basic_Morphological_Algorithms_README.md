## 6. How Do They Work?

### Common Morphological Operations:

1. **Erosion**:
   - Shrinks objects by removing pixels at their boundaries.
   - Removes small noise and separates connected objects.
   - Formula: `E(I, B) = {z | (B)z ⊆ I}`

2. **Dilation**:
   - Expands objects by adding pixels at their boundaries.
   - Fills small gaps and connects close components.
   - Formula: `D(I, B) = {z | (B̂)z ∩ I ≠ ∅}`

3. **Opening**:
   - Combines erosion followed by dilation.
   - Removes small noise while preserving object size.
   - Formula: `O(I, B) = D(E(I, B), B)`

4. **Closing**:
   - Combines dilation followed by erosion.
   - Fills small holes and gaps within objects.
   - Formula: `C(I, B) = E(D(I, B), B)`

5. **Hit-or-Miss Transform**:
   - Identifies specific patterns or shapes in an image.
   - Formula: `H(I, B1, B2) = (E(I, B1) ∩ E(Ic, B2))`

## Practical Examples:

### Example 1: Noise Removal
- Apply **Opening** to eliminate small noise from a binary image.
- Use a structuring element smaller than the objects of interest.

### Example 2: Object Filling
- Apply **Closing** to fill gaps or holes in an object.
- Use a structuring element slightly larger than the gaps.

### Example 3: Feature Extraction
- Use **Hit-or-Miss Transform** to locate specific shapes in the image.
- Select structuring elements that match the target pattern.
