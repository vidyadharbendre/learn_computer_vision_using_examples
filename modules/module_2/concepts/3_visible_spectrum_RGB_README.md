# Understanding the Visible Spectrum and RGB Representation

## 1. What is VIBGYOR?
**VIBGYOR** stands for the colors of the visible light spectrum in the following order:
- **V** - Violet
- **I** - Indigo
- **B** - Blue
- **G** - Green
- **Y** - Yellow
- **O** - Orange
- **R** - Red

This spectrum is observed when white light passes through a prism and is split into its constituent colors. These colors are arranged in order of increasing wavelength, from **Violet** (shortest wavelength) to **Red** (longest wavelength).

## 2. What is RGB?
**RGB** (Red, Green, Blue) is a color model used in electronic displays and digital media. It works by combining red, green, and blue light in various intensities to reproduce a wide range of colors.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Red (R)**, **Green (G)**, and **Blue (B)** are the primary colors in the RGB model.
- When these colors are combined at different intensities, they can create virtually any color.
- Combining red, green, and blue at full intensity produces white light.

## 3. Why RGB for Digital Representation?

### 3.1. Additive Color Mixing
RGB follows the principle of **additive color mixing**. When you add more light of different colors, you get closer to white. This is the opposite of how paints mix (subtractive color mixing).

### 3.2. Human Eye Perception
The human eye has **three types of color receptors**, each sensitive to red, green, or blue light. The RGB color model is based on this, making it well-suited for representing colors in a way that matches our visual perception.

### 3.3. Efficiency in Technology
RGB is a practical model for use in digital systems, such as:
- **Computer displays**
- **TVs**
- **Cameras**
- **Projectors**

## Conclusion

The **VIBGYOR** spectrum describes how light behaves in nature when passed through a prism, while **RGB** is a digital color model that efficiently replicates how humans perceive colors and how displays function.
