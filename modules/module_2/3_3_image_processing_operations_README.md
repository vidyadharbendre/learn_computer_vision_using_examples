# Image Processing Operations

Image processing involves various operations that can be classified into three main categories based on the scope and approach of the processing:

## 1. Point Operations (Pixel Level Transformations)

Point operations, also known as pixel-level transformations, are operations that process each pixel independently. These operations can be applied directly to the pixel values without considering the neighboring pixels. Examples include:

- **Brightness Adjustment**: Modifying pixel values to brighten or darken an image.
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Adjusting the range of pixel intensity values to improve visual quality.
- **Thresholding**: Converting a grayscale image to a binary image based on a threshold value.
- **Gamma Correction**: Adjusting the brightness of an image according to a gamma curve.

## 2. Local Operations (Neighborhood Processing)

Local operations consider the relationship between a pixel and its neighbors. These operations are typically performed using convolution with various filters. Examples include:

- **Convolution**: A mathematical operation used to apply filters (kernels) to an image to extract features.
- **Filters**:
  - **Smoothing Filters**: Used to reduce noise and detail (e.g., Gaussian blur).
  - **Sharpening Filters**: Enhance edges and fine details (e.g., Laplacian filter).
- **Edge Detection**: Identifying significant changes in intensity to detect edges in an image (e.g., Sobel, Canny).
- **Directional Operations**:
  - **Horizontal Edge Detection**: Capturing edges that run horizontally.
  - **Vertical Edge Detection**: Capturing edges that run vertically.

## 3. Global Operations (Image Level Transformations)

Global operations analyze and modify the entire image as a whole. These operations are not limited to individual pixels or neighborhoods but consider the overall structure and frequency components of the image. Examples include:

- **Fourier Transform**: A mathematical transform that decomposes an image into its frequency components, enabling frequency domain analysis and filtering.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Enhancing image contrast by redistributing the intensity values across the entire range.
- **Image Registration**: Aligning multiple images into a common coordinate system for comparison or analysis.

## Conclusion

Understanding these categories of image processing operations is crucial for effectively manipulating and analyzing images for various applications in computer vision, machine learning, and image analysis.
