## Inverse Fourier Transform: Reconstructing the Signal

The **Forward Fourier Transform** takes a signal **f(x)** from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, resulting in **F(u)**, which captures the amplitudes and phases of its constituent sinusoids.

Now, we can apply the **Inverse Fourier Transform** to go in the reverse direction â€” from the frequency domain back to the spatial domain. This process reconstructs the original signal **f(x)** from the amplitudes and phases of its sinusoids. 

Importantly, there is **no loss of information** in either direction. The signal can be transformed back and forth between the spatial and frequency domains without any distortion or loss.
