# Fourier Transform Overview

## Fourier Transform: Signal Representation

The **Fourier Transform** allows us to represent a signal, **f(x)**, in terms of the **amplitudes** and **phases** of its constituent **sinusoids**. It transforms the signal from the spatial domain, **f(x)**, to the frequency domain, **F(u)**.

For each frequency component, **u**, the transformed signal **F(u)** captures:
- The **amplitude**, which indicates the strength of that frequency component.
- The **phase**, which determines the shift or alignment of the corresponding sinusoid.

This dual representation of amplitude and phase is essential for fully reconstructing the original signal from its frequency components.
