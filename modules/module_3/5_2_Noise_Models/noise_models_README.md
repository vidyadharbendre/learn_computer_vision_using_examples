## 1. Introduction to Image Noise

Image noise refers to random variations in pixel values that degrade the quality of an image. Noise is often introduced during image acquisition, transmission, or processing, and can be modeled using mathematical functions. Understanding and accurately modeling noise types are essential for designing noise reduction filters and restoration techniques.

## 2. Types of Noise

### Gaussian Noise
Gaussian noise is characterized by a normal distribution with a mean ($\mu$) and variance ($\sigma^2$). It is common in electronic devices and is mathematically represented as:

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

### Rayleigh Noise
Rayleigh noise has a skewed distribution commonly found in radar and ultrasonic imaging. It is defined as:

$$
p(x) = \frac{x}{\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2 \sigma^2}}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

### Erlang (Gamma) Noise
Erlang or Gamma noise is suitable for modeling noise in images with non-negative values. Its probability density function is given by:

$$
p(x) = \frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

where:
- $k$ is the shape parameter,
- $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.

### Exponential Noise
Exponential noise follows a decreasing distribution and is suitable for low-light imaging noise:

$$
p(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.

### Uniform Noise
Uniform noise has a constant probability over a specific range $[a, b]$ and is represented as:

$$
p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b
$$

### Salt-and-Pepper Noise
Salt-and-Pepper noise, also known as impulse noise, appears as random black and white pixels in the image. It can be represented as:

$$
p(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
p_{salt} & \text{for maximum intensity} \\
p_{pepper} & \text{for minimum intensity} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

where:
- $p_{salt}$ is the probability of white pixels,
- $p_{pepper}$ is the probability of black pixels.

### Periodic Noise
Periodic noise appears as repetitive patterns in the frequency domain and can be represented as a sinusoidal function superimposed on the image:

$$
I(x, y) = I_0(x, y) + A \sin(2 \pi (u x + v y) + \phi)
$$

where:
- $A$ is the amplitude,
- $u$ and $v$ are the spatial frequencies,
- $\phi$ is the phase.

## 3. Spatial and Frequency Properties of Noise

Noise can exhibit different properties in the spatial and frequency domains:
- **Spatial Properties**: Spatial noise analysis focuses on how noise manifests across the image pixels. For example, Salt-and-Pepper noise affects specific pixels with high contrast, while Gaussian noise is distributed over all pixels.
- **Frequency Properties**: Frequency domain analysis is useful for identifying and isolating periodic noise, as it appears as peaks in the frequency spectrum. Frequency analysis helps design filters to target specific types of noise without affecting the entire image.

## 4. Noise Probability Density Functions (PDFs)

Different types of noise are characterized by unique probability density functions (PDFs):
- **Gaussian PDF**: Symmetrical and characterized by mean and variance.
- **Rayleigh PDF**: Skewed distribution, frequently observed in radar images.
- **Erlang (Gamma) PDF**: Suitable for modeling non-negative pixel values.
- **Exponential PDF**: Decreasing distribution, suitable for low-light noise.
- **Uniform PDF**: Constant distribution over a specific range.
- **Salt-and-Pepper PDF**: High contrast PDF with binary pixel values.

Each PDF is critical for modeling noise mathematically, enabling the design of specific noise reduction techniques.

## 5. Estimating Noise Parameters

Estimating noise parameters involves statistical analysis of the image to quantify noise levels and characteristics:
- **Gaussian Noise**: Estimate mean and variance by calculating the pixel value distribution.
- **Rayleigh Noise**: Estimate the scale parameter ($\sigma$) by analyzing the skewness of pixel intensity values.
- **Erlang (Gamma) Noise**: Estimate the shape ($k$) and rate ($\lambda$) parameters through maximum likelihood estimation.
- **Exponential Noise**: Estimate the rate parameter ($\lambda$) by observing the decay rate of pixel intensity.
- **Uniform Noise**: Calculate the minimum and maximum pixel intensity values to determine the range $[a, b]$.
- **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Calculate the probability of extreme intensity values (0 or 255) to estimate the noise probability.

Estimating noise parameters is crucial for designing adaptive filters and restoration techniques tailored to specific noise types.
