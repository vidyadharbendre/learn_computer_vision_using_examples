| **Technique**                         | **Concept**                                                                                              | **Advantages**                                                                 | **Limitations**                                                                    | **Transition**                                                                                       |

| **1. Gradient Operators**             | Detects edges by calculating intensity changes across the image.                                         | Simple method to highlight edges.                                              | Sensitive to noise; limited to detecting edges in one direction.                    | Introduce directional filters for detecting horizontal and vertical edges separately.                |
| **2. Directional Filters (x and y)**  | Applies filters along x and y axes to capture horizontal and vertical edges separately.                  | More effective edge detection in specific directions.                          | Still sensitive to noise, causing false edges.                                      | Use Sobel and Prewitt filters to improve noise resistance.                                          |
| **3. Sobel and Prewitt Filters**      | Uses convolution kernels to detect edges while increasing resistance to noise.                           | Improved noise resistance due to larger kernels.                                | Can produce thick/blurred edges; struggles with high-frequency noise.               | Apply second-derivative methods like Laplacian for sharper edge detection.                          |
| **4. Laplacian Operator**             | Calculates second derivative to highlight areas with rapid intensity change for distinct edges.          | Higher sensitivity to intensity changes.                                       | Amplifies noise, leading to exaggerated results.                                    | Smooth the image with noise-removal techniques before edge detection.                               |
| **5. Smoothing (Noise Removal)**      | Reduces noise through filters like Gaussian blur, preserving major edges.                               | Creates a cleaner image for more accurate edge detection.                      | Excessive smoothing can blur significant edges.                                     | Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine edges to a single pixel width.                         |
| **6. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**  | Refines edges by keeping only the strongest pixels in edge direction, suppressing weaker edges nearby.  | Produces single-pixel-wide, well-defined edges.                                | Requires careful thresholding to avoid losing significant weak edges.               | Apply thresholding to isolate meaningful edges while removing weaker ones.                          |
| **7. Thresholding Techniques**        | Retains edges above a certain intensity threshold, finalizing the edge map.                             | Isolates meaningful edges and removes unnecessary noise.                       | Choosing an optimal threshold can be challengingâ€”too high discards edges; too low retains noise. | Use adaptive or multi-threshold techniques to dynamically adjust for varying image contexts.         |
| **8. Canny Edge Detection**           | Combines all steps (smoothing, gradient, NMS, and thresholding) for robust edge detection.              | Produces clean, well-defined edges with minimal noise; widely used in edge detection. | Requires tuning of thresholds and smoothing; computationally intensive.             | Future: Machine learning and deep learning techniques are being developed for adaptive edge detection. |
