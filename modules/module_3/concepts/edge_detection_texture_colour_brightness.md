## Introduction

The goal of this project is to detect image boundaries (edges) by combining texture, brightness, and color features. By training a machine learning algorithm on these features, we aim to classify each pixel as an edge or non-edge, achieving more accurate and refined edge detection compared to traditional methods.

## Feature Extraction Techniques

### Texture Features
- **Definition**: Texture captures patterns and structures in an image, such as roughness, smoothness, or repetitive patterns.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Gabor Filters**: Convolves the image with filters tuned to specific orientations and frequencies to detect texture.
  - **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**: Encodes local texture by comparing pixel intensities around each pixel.
  - **Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)**: Measures spatial relationships between pixels to extract textural patterns.

### Brightness Features
- **Definition**: Brightness refers to the intensity of light at each pixel, distinguishing between light and dark areas.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Grayscale Intensity**: Directly use grayscale intensity values as a measure of brightness.
  - **Gradient Magnitude**: Compute the gradient in brightness to highlight intensity changes, often indicative of edges.

### Color Features
- **Definition**: Color information is used to detect boundaries where there are changes in color, making it effective for colorful and complex images.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Color Histograms**: Quantifies the distribution of colors in local regions.
  - **Color Gradients**: Measures changes in color values across pixels.
  - **Color Spaces**: Using color spaces such as RGB, HSV, or LAB to improve boundary detection.

## Combining Features for Classification
- **Feature Vector**: A feature vector is created by combining texture, brightness, and color features for each pixel.
- **Feature Engineering**: Normalize features for consistency, and experiment with feature combinations (e.g., texture with brightness) to optimize performance.

## Machine Learning Models

### Model Choices
- **Traditional Models**:
  - **Random Forests** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Useful for structured feature input, especially for binary classification.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Serves as a baseline model for comparison.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Effective for learning spatial hierarchies for boundary detection.
  - **Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)** or **UNet**: Designed for pixel-wise classification, ideal for detailed edge maps.

## Training the Model

1. **Dataset**: Prepare a labeled dataset with images and their corresponding edge maps (manually annotated or using Canny edge maps as a proxy).
2. **Training Process**:
   - Balance the dataset with equal edge and non-edge pixels.
   - Use data augmentation to make the model more robust to various transformations.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the model using precision, recall, and F1-score to understand its performance on edge detection.

## Model Combination and Tuning

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Experiment with hyperparameters such as learning rate, depth of the model, and feature weighting to achieve optimal results.

### Fusion Techniques
- Combine the output of texture, brightness, and color models using **ensemble techniques** or **feature fusion layers** in deep learning frameworks.

### Post-Processing
- Apply **Non-Maximum Suppression** to thin detected edges.
- Use **Morphological Operations** (like dilation and erosion) for refining the final edge map.

## Challenges
- **Noise Sensitivity**: Texture and brightness can be affected by noise, potentially causing false edges.
- **Illumination Variance**: Changes in lighting can impact brightness and color consistency.
- **Complex Textures and Backgrounds**: Distinguishing between textures and true edges in complex images is challenging.

## Evaluation and Fine-tuning

1. **Testing**: Validate the model on a diverse set of images to ensure robustness under various conditions.
2. **Refinement**: Use feedback from evaluation metrics to iteratively improve feature selection, model parameters, and fusion techniques.
