# Importance of Edges in Image Processing

Edges play a crucial role in image processing as they provide valuable information about the structure and shape of objects within an image. By detecting edges, we can identify essential features, track objects, and perform detailed image analysis, which is fundamental for computer vision applications.

## Why Are Edges Important?

Edges are vital for several reasons, as they allow us to capture and analyze key features that contribute to understanding images and scenes.
